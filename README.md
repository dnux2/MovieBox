# SEEN

A movie discovery app for iOS built with SwiftUI and the TMDB API. Browse popular movies, search with debounce, view details, and save your favorites.

## Features

- Home grid of popular movies with pull-to-refresh and infinite scroll
- Movie details screen
- Search with debounce, plus empty and no-results states
- Favorites saved locally on the device
- Clear loading, error and empty states (try it in airplane mode)
- Light and dark mode support

## Tech

- SwiftUI, iOS 17+
- `NavigationStack` (one per tab) with a `TabView` for Home / Search / Favorites
- async/await networking with `URLSession`, through a single shared `APIClient`
- `Codable` models matching the TMDB JSON
- `@Observable` view models that expose loading / loaded / empty / error states
- Debounced search using `.task(id:)`
- `UserDefaults` for locally saved favorites
- Semantic system colors, so light and dark mode work out of the box

## Project structure

```
MovieBox/
  Models/       Codable models (Movie, MovieDetail, ...)
  Services/     APIClient, MovieService, FavoritesStore, Config
  ViewModels/   Screen logic and state (loading / loaded / empty / error)
  Views/        Screens and reusable components
```

Networking is kept out of the views, so each screen only talks to its view model.

## Setup

1. Get a Read Access Token from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
2. Copy `Secrets.example.xcconfig` to `Secrets.xcconfig` and put your token in it:
```
   TMDB_TOKEN = your_token_here
```
3. Open `MovieBox.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run.

`Secrets.xcconfig` is in `.gitignore`, so the token is never committed.
